    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // console.log(players, team);

    //If you look at players[3] and team[3] they ARE THE SAME!
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // one day
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // this will take every item out of the iterable and put it into the containing array
    team4[3] = 'hee hawww';
    // console.log(team4);
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed.

    // with Objects
    var person = {
        name: 'Cory Trimm',

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 11 });
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person}; //not yet released, but hopefully will be soon. Similar to React.

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
